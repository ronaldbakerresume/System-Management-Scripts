### **README: Add Prefix or Suffix to File Names**

---

#### **Script Name**: `add_prefix_suffix_to_filenames.sh`  
**Developer**: Ronald Baker  

---

### **Overview**
This script allows you to add a **prefix** and/or **suffix** to the file names in a specified directory. It preserves the file extensions and ensures the original file contents remain unaltered. Use it to organize or standardize file naming conventions effectively.

---

### **Usage**
```bash
./add_prefix_suffix_to_filenames.sh <target_directory> <prefix> <suffix>
```

- **`<target_directory>`**: The directory containing the files to rename (required).  
- **`<prefix>`**: The string to prepend to each file name (optional; defaults to an empty string).  
- **`<suffix>`**: The string to append to each file name (optional; defaults to an empty string).  

---

### **Example Usages**

#### **Add a Prefix to File Names**
```bash
./add_prefix_suffix_to_filenames.sh /path/to/files myprefix_ ""
```
- Files:  
  `file1.txt` â†’ `myprefix_file1.txt`  
  `file2.jpg` â†’ `myprefix_file2.jpg`

---

#### **Add a Suffix to File Names**
```bash
./add_prefix_suffix_to_filenames.sh /path/to/files "" _backup
```
- Files:  
  `file1.txt` â†’ `file1_backup.txt`  
  `file2.jpg` â†’ `file2_backup.jpg`

---

#### **Add Both Prefix and Suffix**
```bash
./add_prefix_suffix_to_filenames.sh /path/to/files new_ _v1
```
- Files:  
  `file1.txt` â†’ `new_file1_v1.txt`  
  `file2.jpg` â†’ `new_file2_v1.jpg`

---

#### **Handle Default Values**
If either the **prefix** or **suffix** is omitted, the script uses an empty string (`""`) for that part of the name. For example:
```bash
./add_prefix_suffix_to_filenames.sh /path/to/files prefix_ ""
```
- Files:  
  `example.doc` â†’ `prefix_example.doc`

---

### **How It Works**
1. The script iterates over all files in the specified directory.
2. Each fileâ€™s base name and extension are separated using string manipulation.
3. The new file name is constructed by combining:
   - The **prefix** (if provided).  
   - The original base name of the file.  
   - The **suffix** (if provided).  
   - The file extension.  
4. The file is renamed using the `mv` command.

---

### **Prerequisites**
- Ensure you have execute permissions for the script:
  ```bash
  chmod +x add_prefix_suffix_to_filenames.sh
  ```
- Verify that the **target directory** exists and contains files to rename.

---

### **Output**
- For each file renamed, the script logs the operation:
  ```bash
  Renaming: /path/to/files/file1.txt -> /path/to/files/myprefix_file1_backup.txt
  ```
- Upon completion, it displays:
  ```bash
  File renaming with prefix and suffix complete.
  ```

---

### **Error Handling**
- If the **target directory** is not provided, the script will terminate and display the usage message:
  ```bash
  Usage: ./add_prefix_suffix_to_filenames.sh <target_directory> <prefix> <suffix>
  ```
- The script skips directories and only processes regular files.

---

### **Limitations**
- The script only operates on files in the **top-level directory**. Subdirectories are not processed.
- Be cautious with prefixes or suffixes containing special characters, as they may affect file paths.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Add recursive functionality to process files in nested directories.
- Implement a dry-run mode to preview changes before renaming files.
