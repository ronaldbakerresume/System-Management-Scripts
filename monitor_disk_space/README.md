### **README: Disk Space Monitor Script**

---

#### **Script Name**: `monitor_disk_space.sh`  
**Developer**: Ronald Baker  

---

### **Overview**
This script monitors the free disk space on all mounted filesystems. If usage exceeds a defined threshold, it logs an alert and optionally sends an email notification. This tool helps ensure that low disk space issues are identified and addressed promptly.

---

### **Usage**
```bash
./monitor_disk_space.sh
```

- **No arguments required**.  

---

### **Features**
1. **Threshold-Based Alerts**:
   - Alerts are triggered when disk usage exceeds the specified threshold (default: 20%).

2. **Logging**:
   - Alerts are logged in a daily log file (`disk_space_alerts_<YYYYMMDD>.log`).

3. **Email Notifications** (Optional):
   - Includes an option to send email alerts to an administrator.

4. **User-Friendly Output**:
   - Displays the status of all filesystems, highlighting those with low disk space.

---

### **How It Works**
1. **Define Threshold**:
   - Set the disk usage threshold as a percentage. Default is 20%:
     ```bash
     THRESHOLD=20
     ```

2. **Analyze Filesystems**:
   - Uses the `df -h` command to retrieve disk usage information for all mounted filesystems:
     ```bash
     df -h | awk 'NR>1 {print $5, $6}'
     ```

3. **Check Against Threshold**:
   - Compares the usage percentage for each filesystem against the threshold. If exceeded, logs an alert:
     ```bash
     if [ "$usage" -gt "$THRESHOLD" ]; then
         echo "$(date): ALERT! Low disk space on $mount_point ($usage% used)" | tee -a "$ALERT_LOG"
     fi
     ```

4. **Log Alerts**:
   - Saves alerts to a daily log file named `disk_space_alerts_<YYYYMMDD>.log`.

5. **Optional Email Notifications**:
   - Uncomment the following line to enable email notifications:
     ```bash
     echo "Low disk space on $mount_point ($usage% used)" | mail -s "Disk Space Alert" admin@example.com
     ```

### **Example Workflow**

#### **1. Script Output**
When disk usage exceeds the threshold, the script outputs:
```
Checking disk space on all mounted filesystems...
2023-12-15 10:45:00: ALERT! Low disk space on /dev/sda1 (85% used)
2023-12-15 10:45:00: ALERT! Low disk space on /home (91% used)
```

#### **2. Log File Example (`disk_space_alerts_20231215.log`)**
```
2023-12-15 10:45:00: ALERT! Low disk space on /dev/sda1 (85% used)
2023-12-15 10:45:00: ALERT! Low disk space on /home (91% used)
```

---

### **Customizing the Script**

#### **Change Disk Space Threshold**
Modify the `THRESHOLD` variable to set a custom usage limit:
```bash
THRESHOLD=30
```

#### **Send Email Alerts**
Uncomment the email line and replace `admin@example.com` with the desired recipient address:
```bash
echo "Low disk space on $mount_point ($usage% used)" | mail -s "Disk Space Alert" admin@example.com
```
Ensure the `mail` utility is installed:
```bash
sudo apt install mailutils  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install mailx      # Red Hat/CentOS
```

#### **Exclude Specific Mount Points**
Add a condition to skip specific filesystems (e.g., `/tmp`):
```bash
if [[ "$mount_point" == "/tmp" ]]; then
    continue
fi
```

---

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Executable Permissions**:
   - Ensure the script is executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x monitor_disk_space.sh
     ```

2. **Access to `df` and `awk`**:
   - These utilities are typically available in most Linux distributions.

3. **Email Notifications**:
   - To send email alerts, ensure `mail` is installed and configured.

---

### **Error Handling**
1. **Missing Utilities**:
   - If `df` or `awk` is missing, the script will fail. Install missing utilities:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install coreutils gawk  # Debian/Ubuntu
     sudo yum install coreutils gawk  # Red Hat/CentOS
     ```

2. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure the script has write permissions for the log file location.

---

### **Limitations**
1. **Static Threshold**:
   - The threshold is fixed. Dynamic thresholds based on filesystem size or type are not implemented.

2. **Email Configuration**:
   - Email notifications require additional setup and may fail if the `mail` utility is misconfigured.

3. **Temporary Filesystems**:
   - Includes temporary filesystems like `/dev` or `/tmp` unless explicitly excluded.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Add support for **disk usage trends** and predictions.
2. Include **email templates** for more detailed notifications.
3. Implement a **dashboard** for real-time monitoring of disk usage.
4. Integrate with system monitoring tools like **Nagios** or **Prometheus**.
