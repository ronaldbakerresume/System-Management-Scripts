### **README: Organize Files into Folders by Name Script**

---

#### **Script Name**: `organize_by_name.sh`  
**Developer**: Ronald Baker  

---

### **Overview**
This script organizes files in the current directory by creating folders based on each file's name (excluding its extension) and moving the respective file into its corresponding folder. Itâ€™s an efficient way to group files by their names while retaining their extensions.

---

### **Usage**
```bash
./organize_by_name.sh
```

- **No arguments required**.  

---

### **Features**
1. **Name-Based Organization**:
   - Groups files into folders named after the file (excluding extensions).

2. **Automatic Folder Creation**:
   - Creates a new folder for each unique file name.

3. **Safe File Movement**:
   - Ensures files are moved without overwriting or losing them.

4. **Dynamic and Scalable**:
   - Handles any number of files in the current directory.

---

### **How It Works**
1. **Iterate Over Files**:
   - Loops through all files in the current directory:
     ```bash
     for file in *; do
     ```

2. **Check for Regular Files**:
   - Ensures that only regular files (not directories or special files) are processed:
     ```bash
     if [ -f "$file" ]; then
     ```

3. **Extract File Name Without Extension**:
   - Strips the file extension to determine the folder name:
     ```bash
     folder_name="${file%.*}"
     ```

4. **Create Folders**:
   - Creates a folder named after the file (if it doesn't already exist):
     ```bash
     mkdir -p "$folder_name"
     ```

5. **Move Files**:
   - Moves each file into its respective folder:
     ```bash
     mv "$file" "$folder_name"
     ```

6. **Completion Message**:
   - Logs a success message for each file moved and a summary at the end.

### **Example Workflow**

#### **Before Running the Script**
Directory contents:
```
document.txt
image.jpg
script.sh
data.csv
```

#### **Run the Script**
```bash
./organize_by_name.sh
```

#### **After Running the Script**
Directory contents:
```
document/
    document.txt
image/
    image.jpg
script/
    script.sh
data/
    data.csv
```

---

### **Customizing the Script**

#### **Handle Duplicate Files**
To prevent overwriting if duplicate files exist, rename duplicates before moving:
```bash
mv "$file" "$folder_name/$(basename "$file" ."$extension")_$(date +%s).$extension"
```

#### **Exclude Certain Files**
Add a condition to skip specific files (e.g., hidden files or this script itself):
```bash
if [[ "$file" == "organize_by_name.sh" || "$file" == .* ]]; then
    continue
fi
```

#### **Process Only Specific File Types**
Restrict the script to work on certain file types (e.g., `.txt`):
```bash
if [[ "$file" == *.txt ]]; then
```

---

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Executable Permissions**:
   - Ensure the script is executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x organize_by_name.sh
     ```

2. **Sufficient Space**:
   - Ensure there is enough disk space to create folders and move files.

3. **Valid Directory**:
   - Run the script in a directory containing the files to be organized.

---

### **Output**

#### **Sample Terminal Output**:
```
Moved 'document.txt' to folder 'document/'
Moved 'image.jpg' to folder 'image/'
Moved 'script.sh' to folder 'script/'
Moved 'data.csv' to folder 'data/'
All files have been organized into their respective folders!
```

---

### **Error Handling**
1. **Non-File Items**:
   - Skips directories, symbolic links, or special files using:
     ```bash
     if [ -f "$file" ]; then
     ```

2. **Empty Directory**:
   - If no files are found, the script completes without action.

3. **File Name Conflicts**:
   - Overwrites existing files with the same name in the target folder unless modified to prevent it.

---

### **Limitations**
1. **Non-Recursive**:
   - Organizes files only in the current directory. To include subdirectories, modify the loop:
     ```bash
     find . -type f | while read -r file; do
     ```

2. **One File per Folder**:
   - Moves only the file with the same name into the folder, even if other related files exist.

3. **No Extension Handling**:
   - Files without extensions will create folders with their full name.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Add an option to **group related files** into the same folder (e.g., `image.jpg` and `image.png`).
2. Include **recursive folder organization** for subdirectories.
3. Implement a **dry-run mode** to preview changes before applying them.
